If the first statement inside the recursive function is the recursive call 

Example:
    void fun(int n){
        if(n > 0){
            fun(n-1);

            //operations
        }
    }

    - Function doesn't do any process during calling time, only returning time 
    - Can't really convert to a loop, but can
